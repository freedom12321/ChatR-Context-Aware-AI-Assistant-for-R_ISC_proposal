# ChatR: A Context-Aware R Programming Assistant 

📄 **[View the detail proposal here](https://freedom12321.github.io/ChatR-Context-Aware-AI-Assistant-for-R_ISC_proposal/)**

---

## Overview  

**ChatR** is an open-source, context-aware intelligent assistant designed for the R programming ecosystem.  
Unlike generic AI copilots, ChatR operates **inside the R environment**, providing reliable, reproducible, and privacy-respecting support for R workflows in statistics, bioinformatics, social sciences, and beyond.  

## Why ChatR?  

R users today face growing challenges:  
- Complex multi-step workflows across dozens of packages  
- Constant need to search through documentation and debug errors  
- AI copilots that hallucinate, ignore session context, or fail in secure/offline environments  

These issues slow down experts, discourage beginners, and block adoption in sensitive domains (e.g., healthcare, government).  

## Our Solution  

ChatR closes this gap by delivering:  
- **R session awareness** – understands your objects, packages, and errors  
- **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** – grounded in official docs and vignettes  
- **Safe tool execution** – CRAN search, environment inspection, code sandboxing  
- **Reproducible, cited answers** – to strengthen trust and transparency  
- **Offline mode** – smaller local LLMs for restricted environments  
- **IDE integration** – RStudio add-in, VS Code extension, MCP/LangChain support  

## Development Plan  

- **Months 1–2**: Infrastructure setup & initial knowledge base  
- **Months 3–5**: MVP with console chat, retrieval, and citations  
- **Months 6–9**: Expanded tools, multi-step reasoning, evaluation harness  
- **Months 10–12**: CRAN release, docs, tutorials, community outreach  

## Deliverables  

- `ChatR` R package v1.0 released on CRAN/R-universe  
- IDE add-ins and command-line integration  
- Error diagnosis module covering ≥80% of common R errors  
- Knowledge base: Base R, recommended pkgs, 100+ CRAN pkgs, select Bioconductor  
- Complete documentation, vignettes, and tutorials  
- Community adoption (testers, contributors, forum mentions)  

## Budget & Support  

- **~$10,000 total**  
  - ~90% developer compensation (20 hrs/week × 12 months)  
  - ~10% tutorials, community engagement, incidental costs  
- Funds disbursed milestone-by-milestone  

## Impact  

ChatR will:  
- Lower barriers for newcomers  
- Save experts time and improve reproducibility  
- Enable AI assistance in privacy-sensitive and offline environments  
- Strengthen R’s community infrastructure for long-term growth
