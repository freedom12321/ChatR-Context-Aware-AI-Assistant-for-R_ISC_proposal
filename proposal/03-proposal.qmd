How are you going to solve the problem? Include the concrete actions you
will take and an estimated timeline. What are likely failure modes and
how will you recover from them?

## Overview ##
<!--
At a high-level address what your proposal is and how it will address
the problem identified. Highlight any benefits to the R Community that
follow from solving the problem. This should be your most compelling
section.

Include concrete actions you will take and estimated timeline.

We propose **ChatR**, a context-aware AI assistant built inside the R ecosystem that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), session awareness, and tool invocation. Through a chat interface (R console, RStudio add-in, or VS Code), ChatR classifies queries, gathers context, retrieves documentation, executes code when needed, and returns cited answers. By integrating with R and supporting offline use, ChatR will reduce time spent on debugging and documentation search, improve reproducibility with authoritative sources, and make R more accessible for newcomers in statistics, bioinformatics, social sciences, etc.  

**Timeline**

- **Months 1–2**: Design, infrastructure setup, initial knowledge base.  
- **Months 3–5**: MVP delivery and early user testing.  
- **Months 6–9**: Expanded tools, autonomous agent loop, evaluation.  
- **Months 10–12**: Packaging, documentation, CRAN release, community outreach.  

**Failure modes & recovery**

- *LLM unreliability*: Mitigated by constraining outputs to retrieved documentation.  
- *Performance bottlenecks*: Use efficient vector stores, quantized models, caching.  
- *Scope creep*: Prioritize core workflows; defer advanced features to future work.  

## Detail

-->

### Minimum Viable Product

<!--
What is the smallest thing you can build that delivers value to your users?
-->

By Month 3, ChatR will demonstrate end-to-end functionality with:  

- R console chat interface.  
- Query classification (docs/help, code, error fix).  
- Knowledge base of base R + tidyverse docs (embeddings).  
- Basic tools: CRAN search, safe code execution sandbox.  
- Responses grounded in retrieved text with citations.  

### Architecture

<!--
What does the high-level architecture look like?
-->

ChatR will use a modular design with:  

- **Interface:** R console first, then IDE add-ins (RStudio, Shiny).  
- **Core & Retrieval:** Orchestrator with embedding search (FAISS or R alternatives).  
- **Tools:** Docs/CRAN search, code execution, environment inspection.  
- **LLM & Dialogue:** Online APIs or offline OSS models with multi-turn memory.  
- **Integration:** MCP/LangChain for extensibility; plumber for local API.  

### Assumptions

<!--
What assumptions are you making that, if proven false, would invalidate the project?
-->

- **User environment:** ChatR installable; offline mode with small models or fallback to API.  
- **Tool safety:** Code restricted to R session with safeguards.  

If any assumptions fail (e.g., offline models prove too resource-heavy), fallback options such as smaller KBs or API-based models will be provided.

### External dependencies

<!--
What external dependencies does the project have (e.g. libraries, services, other projects, etc.)?
-->

FAISS (with Rcpp fallbacks) for retrieval, OpenAI or local OSS models for LLMs/embeddings, and MCP/LangChain with plumber for integration.
