# Success
<!--
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a
thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery
-->

## Definition of done
<!--
What does success look like?
-->

- Release **ChatR v1.0** (CRAN/Universe) with context-aware assistance, online/offline modes, error diagnosis, broad KB coverage, documentation, and evidence of community adoption.  

## Measuring success
<!--
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use
along the way
-->

- Achieve ≥80% accuracy vs baseline, positive user feedback (≥4/5), ≥50 testers with external contributions, and case studies showing time savings and novice accessibility.  


## Future work
<!--
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself
and/or the community in general?
-->

- Sustain through a community-led team, improved AI models, cross-language expansion, deeper IDE integration, community-driven KB, new features (multi-modal, learning mode), and educational impact studies.
