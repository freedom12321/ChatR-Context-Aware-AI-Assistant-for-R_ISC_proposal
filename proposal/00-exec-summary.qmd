## Overview  
**ChatR** is an open-source, context-aware assistant for the R ecosystem. In **12 months**, we will deliver an **R package** and **IDE add-in** (with CLI and offline mode) for secure environments. Unlike generic copilots, ChatR runs **inside R**, accessing session objects, packages, and errors to provide accurate, reproducible support for workflows in statistics, bioinformatics, social sciences, etc.  

## Goals & Methods  
- **Reliable help:** Reduce hallucinations; ground answers in official docs with citations.  
- **Offline-ready, community-led:** Works in restricted settings; developed openly.  
- **Core methods:** R session integration, RAG, safe execution, and agent compatibility

## Outcomes  
- **Adoption & Efficiency:** R package + IDE plugins with offline support; faster onboarding and expert time savings.  
- **Reproducibility:** Grounded, cited, and logged assistance. 

## Deliverables  
- A fully functional, community-adopted R package with IDE plugins and offline support.  

## Budget  
- **~$10,000 total** â€” ~90% developer effort; ~10% tutorials and community engagement.
