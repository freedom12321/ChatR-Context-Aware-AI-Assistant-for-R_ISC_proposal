# The Problem

```{=html}
<!--
Outlining the issue / weak point / problem to be solved by this
proposal. This should be a compelling section that sets the reader up
for the next section - the proposed solution!

It is important to cover:

 - [ ] What the problem is
 - [ ] Who it affects
 - [ ] Why is it a problem
 - [ ] What will solving the problem enable (why should it be solved)
 - [ ] Brief summary of existing work and previous attempts (e.g., relevant R packages)
 - [ ] If proposing changes to R itself: letter of support from R Core member
-->
```

- **What the problem is**  
  - R workflows (import → transform → model → visualize → report) are complex and fragmented.  
  - Generic copilots lack session awareness, hallucinate functions, and cannot run offline, limiting reproducibility and use in secure settings.  

- **Who it affects**  
  - *Novices*: Steep learning curve, opaque errors.  
  - *Experts*: Time lost context-switching and debugging.  
  - *High-stakes users*: (healthcare, government) blocked from cloud copilots due to privacy/security.  

- **Why it is a problem**  
  - Slows research, reduces reproducibility, and raises barriers to adoption.  
  - Offline/secure users are excluded from AI support.  

- **What solving enables**  
  - Productivity gains through faster debugging and search.  
  - Reproducibility with version- and citation-aware answers.  
  - Accessibility for new users and restricted environments.  

- **Existing work**  
  - {ragnar} (RAG), {tidyprompt} (prompt structuring), {ellmer} (LLM integration), {btw} (environment capture).  
  - Useful but fragmented; none provide a unified, session-aware, offline-ready assistant.
